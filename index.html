        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! This website showcases my journey, interests, and projects as I transition into the field of cybersecurity. Whether you're here to explore my work, learn more about my technical skills, or connect professionally, I'm glad you're here.

Cybersecurity excites me because it sits at the intersection of technology, problem-solving, and protecting what matters most—people, data, and systems. I’m especially drawn to areas such as threat intelligence, ethical hacking, and network security. I enjoy dissecting how systems work and how vulnerabilities can be exploited and mitigated. This curiosity fuels my commitment to lifelong learning and continuous improvement.

My ultimate career goal is to become a cybersecurity analyst or penetration tester, working on the frontlines to defend digital infrastructure and help organizations stay resilient against cyber threats. I’m currently gaining hands-on experience through certifications, lab work, and personal projects, and I’m always looking to collaborate with others in the field.

Thanks for visiting—I look forward to connecting!
